## Hey! I'm Nathan ðŸ‘‹

2025 is my 4th year as a CS student at the University of Victoria!<br>

My professional background is in backend software development, but my passion is for applied machine learning. Specifically, exploring the intersection of these two and finding novel, but genuinely impactful, use cases for SOTA AI.<br>

Outside of work, I enjoy building Spotify playlists, solving Rubik's cubes, and visiting beaches.<br>
