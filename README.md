## Hey! I'm Nathan 👋

I've been a developer at heart since my first [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/ca) at age 10.

Currently, I'm a CS student at the University of Victoria.

My bread and butter is backend development (Spring Boot and SQL in its various flavours).

I am currently dedicating my free time to build projects in the direction of music streaming. My dream is to work at Spotify!

Outside of code, I enjoy [speedcubing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rfX6iD0uIE), [hiking](https://www.instagram.com/toomanynathans), and [making Spotify playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/n8tewolf)
