## Hey! I'm Nathan ðŸ‘‹

I am in my 4th year as a CS student at the University of Victoria!
Currently, I am working with Java and Oracle DB at ICBC as a Software Developer.

My background primarily consists of backend softwere development, but my passion is for applied machine learning.
Finding truly helpful use cases for state-of-the-art AI is my favorite problem to solve.

Outside of work, I enjoy Spotify, Rubik's cubes, and exploring nature.
