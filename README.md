## Hey! I'm Nathan ðŸ‘‹

I've been builder since my first [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/ca) at age 10.

Currently, I'm a Software Engineer at ICBC and a CS student at the University of Victoria.

My bread and butter is REST APIs, SQL, and backend automation.<br>
I am also dedicating my free time to build interesting projects which encapsulate anything from machine learning experiments to deployed full-stack applications.

Outside of code, I enjoy [speedcubing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rfX6iD0uIE), [hiking](https://www.instagram.com/toomanynathans), and [making Spotify playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/n8tewolf)
