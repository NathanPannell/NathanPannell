# Hey! I'm Nathan 👋

## 🤗 A Bit About Me

2025 is my 4th year as a CS student at the University of Victoria, and my first as the president of the UVic AI Club!<br>

My professional background is in process optimization and automation, but my passion is for machine learning and backend software development. Specifically, exploring the intersection of these two and finding novel, but genuinely impactful, use cases for SOTA AI.<br>

Outside of work, I enjoy building Spotify playlists, solving Rubik's cubes, and visiting beaches.<br>
